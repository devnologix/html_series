    <!-- a table in HTML is a way to organize and display information in a 
    structured manner, similar to a grid or spreadsheet. It consists of rows and columns, 
    where each cell holds a piece of data or content.

    Imagine you have a table with rows and columns like a tablecloth with rows and columns.
    Each row represents a horizontal line on the tablecloth, while each column represents a 
    vertical line. In each cell of the table, you can place different types of content such 
    as text, numbers, images, or even other elements like buttons or links.

    Tables are commonly used to present data in a neat and organized way, such as displaying 
    schedules, pricing information, or comparison charts. By using HTML tags specifically 
    designed for tables, you can define the structure of the table, set the appearance, and 
    provide accessibility for users who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies. -->

    <!-- 
        The <table> tag in HTML is used to create a structured grid or tabular 
        representation of data. It allows you to organize data into rows and columns, 
        making it easier to present and manipulate information. 
    -->

    <table>
        <!-- This is the main container for the table. -->
        <thead>

            <!-- the <thead> element stands for "table head." 
                It is used to group the header content in an HTML table. 
                The header content typically includes column labels or titles 
                that describe the data in the columns. -->


            <!-- By enclosing the header rows within the <thead> tags, you can 
                semantically indicate that they represent the header section of 
                the table. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies 
                understand the structure and purpose of the table, improving accessibility. -->

            <tr>
                <!-- In HTML, the <tr> element stands for "table row." 
                It is used to define a row 
                within an HTML table. Each row typically contains one or more cells 
                represented by <td> (table data) or <th> (table header) elements. -->

            <!-- The <tr> element helps to structure the data within the
                table by separating it into distinct rows. Each row represents 
                a horizontal line in the table and contains cells that hold 
                the actual content or data. -->
                
                <th>Column 1</th>
<!-- 
                In HTML, the <th> element stands for "table header." 
                    It is used to define a header cell within an HTML table. 
                    The header cell typically contains a label or title that 
                    describes the content of a column or a group of columns in the table. -->

                <th>Column 2</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <!--  This element is used to group the table body content. It should contain 
                one or more <tr> elements. -->
            <!-- <tbody> in HTML can be thought of as the main body or content section 
            of an HTML table. It is like the main part of a table where the actual data 
            is displayed. -->
            <tr>
                <!-- This stands for table row. It represents a row within the table and 
                    is used to contain one or more table cells (<td> or <th>). -->
                <td>Data 1</td>
                <td>Data 2</td>
                <!-- This stands for table data cell. It represents a data cell within a table 
                    row and is used to hold the actual data or content. -->
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Data 3</td>
                <td>Data 4</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
        <tfoot>
            <!-- This element defines the table footer section. Similar to <thead>, it 
                contains <tr> elements. -->
            <tr>
                <td>Total</td>
                <td>Sum of Data</td>
            </tr>
