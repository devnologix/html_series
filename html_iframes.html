    Explain the concept of iframes in HTML and their purpose.


    Imagine you have a web page, and you want to embed another web page or content 
    from another website within it. That's where iframes come into play. An iframe 
    (short for "inline frame") is like a window within a window. It's a way to include 
    a mini-browser window within your main web page.

    Think of iframes as a picture-in-picture feature on a television. You have the main 
    TV screen showing your favorite show, and within that screen, you have a smaller 
    window showing another program or channel.

    In the same way, with iframes, you can have your main web page displaying its 
    content, and within that page, you can embed another web page or content from 
    a different website. It's like having a website inside a website.

    This can be useful in several scenarios. For example:

    Embedding a Google Maps location: You can include a map from Google Maps directly 
    within your web page, allowing visitors to interact with it without leaving your site.

    Integrating social media feeds: You can display a Twitter or Instagram feed directly 
    within your web page, showing the latest posts from your social media accounts.

    Including external content: You can embed videos, presentations, or other web content 
    from external sources, such as YouTube or SlideShare, enriching your web page with 
    multimedia elements.

    Iframes give you the flexibility to integrate external content seamlessly into your 
    web page, providing a way to combine different sources of information and create a more 
    dynamic and interactive user experience.


    An iframe (short for inline frame) is an HTML element used to embed another HTML 
    document within the current document. It allows you to display content from another 
    <!-- source or website within your own page. The <iframe> element is used to create an  -->
    iframe, and you can specify the source URL using the src attribute.

    The purpose of iframes is to provide a way to include external content such as 
    videos, maps, advertisements, or other web pages into your own web page. It enables 
    you to incorporate content from different sources while maintaining the structure and 
    layout of your page.
