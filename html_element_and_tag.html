    <title>HTML Element and Tag</title>

<body>
    Sure! Let's explain the difference between HTML elements and tags in simpler terms:

    HTML Elements: HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. They define the structure 
    and content of the page. An HTML element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag 
    (if applicable). The content is the actual text or other elements nested within the tags. 
    Elements are represented by the angle brackets (< >) and their corresponding tags, such as 
    <p>, <h1>, <img>, etc.

    HTML Element: <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    In this example, the <p> element represents a paragraph. It consists of an opening tag <p>, 
    the content "This is a paragraph.", and a closing tag </p>. The element encapsulates the 
    content within the tags.

    HTML Tags: HTML tags are the keywords or names used to define and enclose HTML elements. 
    They are placed within angle brackets (< >) and come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing 
    tag. The opening tag denotes the start of an element, and the closing tag marks the end. 
    For example, <p> is the opening tag for a paragraph element, and </p> is the closing tag. 
    Some elements, like line breaks or images, may be self-closing and do not require a closing 
    tag.

    HTML Tag: <p> The <p> tag is the HTML tag used to define a paragraph element. It marks the 
    beginning of a paragraph section.


    In Last, HTML elements are the complete structures defined by opening and closing tags, while HTML 
    tags are the specific markers used to define and enclose those elements.
