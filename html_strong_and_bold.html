    The <strong> tag and the <b> tag in HTML are both used to emphasize or highlight text, 
    but they have different underlying meanings and purposes.

    The <strong> tag is used to convey semantic importance or significance to the enclosed text. 
    It indicates that the text is of strong importance, regardless of its visual appearance. 
    By default, most browsers will render the text within the <strong> tag as bold, 
    but the main purpose of <strong> is to convey meaning rather than visual styling. 
    Search engines and assistive technologies for visually impaired users may interpret <strong> 
    text differently or give it more weight when indexing or presenting content.
        
    On the other hand, the <b> tag is primarily used to apply visual styling to text and make it bold. 
    It doesn't carry any specific semantic meaning or convey importance. The <b> tag simply instructs 
    the browser to render the enclosed text in a bold font style. It is often used for presentational 
    purposes when you want to make text visually stand out or add emphasis without implying any 
    specific importance.
        
    In summary, the <strong> tag is used to indicate important or significant content in a semantic 
    way, while the <b> tag is used purely for visual styling to make text bold. It is generally 
    recommended to use <strong> when you want to emphasize text with actual importance or meaning, 
    and reserve <b> for purely presentational purposes.
