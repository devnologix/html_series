    <h1>Input Types</h1>

    <form>

        <!-- a form in HTML is like a container on a website where you can fill in 
        information and submit it. It's like filling out a paper form, but on a computer 
        or phone screen. -->


        <!-- It's made up of different elements called form controls, such as text boxes, 
        checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown menus, and buttons. These controls let users 
        input data and interact with a webpage. -->

        <!-- action="URL" method="HTTP_METHOD" -->


        <!-- The action attribute specifies the URL or server-side script to which the form 
        data should be submitted when the form is submitted. The method attribute defines 
        the HTTP method to be used for the submission, such as "GET" or "POST". -->

        <!-- Text Input -->
        <label for="text-input">Text Input:</label>

        <!-- the <label> element is used to create a label for an input field or form 
        control. -->

        <!-- The for attribute in the <label> element is used to associate the label 
        with a specific input field. -->


        <!--  we have a <label> element that contains the text "Text Input:" as the label 
        for an input field. The for attribute is set to "text-input", which is the id of 
        the input field that this label is associated with. -->


        <!-- The purpose of the label is to provide a visual description or name for the 
        input field. It helps users understand what kind of information is expected to be 
        entered in the associated input field. When a user clicks on the label, it 
        automatically focuses or selects the corresponding input field, making it easier 
        for users to interact with the form. -->


        <input type="text" id="text-input" name="text-input" required><br><br>

        <!-- type="text": This specifies that the input field is of type "text," meaning 
        it is designed to accept plain text input from the user.

        id="text-input": The id attribute uniquely identifies the input field. It is used 
        to associate the input field with a label or for JavaScript manipulation.
        
        name="text-input": The name attribute is used to define the name of the input 
        field. When the form is submitted, the value entered in this field will be sent 
        to the server with this name as the identifier. -->

        <!-- The "required" attribute in an input field is used to specify that the input 
        field must be filled out before submitting a form. When the "required" attribute 
        is applied to an input element, the browser will enforce the validation and prevent 
        form submission if the required field is left empty. This attribute is particularly 
        useful for ensuring that necessary information is provided by the user. -->


        <!-- Password Input -->
        <label for="password-input">Password Input:</label>
        <input type="password" id="password-input" name="password-input" disabled><br><br>

        <!-- The "disabled" attribute in a form input field is used to disable the input 
            field, preventing the user from interacting with or modifying its value. When 
            the "disabled" attribute is applied to an input element, it becomes non-editable
             and appears visually different to indicate that it cannot be interacted with. -->


        <!-- Email Input -->
        <label for="email-input">Email Input:</label>
        <input type="email" id="email-input" name="email-input" autocomplete="email-input"><br><br>


        <!-- The "autocomplete" attribute in an input field is used to control 
            the autofill behavior of a browser. By specifying the "autocomplete" 
            attribute, you can suggest or prevent the browser from autofilling the 
            input field based on previously entered values.

        The "autocomplete" attribute can take various values, such as "on" or "off", to 
        indicate whether the browser should enable or disable autofill. Additionally, 
        you can use specific values to suggest different types of information, such as 
        "name", "email", "address", or "credit-card". -->


        <!-- Number Input -->
        <label for="number-input">Number Input:</label>
        <input type="number" id="number-input" name="number-input"><br><br>

        <!-- Checkbox -->
        <label for="checkbox-input">Checkbox: Option1</label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="checkbox-input" name="checkbox-input" value="option1"><br><br>

        <label for="checkbox-input">Checkbox: Option2</label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="checkbox-input" name="checkbox-input" value="option2"><br><br>
        
        <!-- Checkboxes are often used in forms when there are multiple choices available, 
        and users can select one or more options simultaneously.  -->

        <!-- Radio Buttons -->
        <label for="radio-input1">Radio Input 1:</label>
        <input type="radio" id="radio-input1" name="radio-input" value="option1"><br>
        <label for="radio-input2">Radio Input 2:</label>
        <input type="radio" id="radio-input2" name="radio-input" value="option2"><br><br>

        <!-- Radio buttons are often used in forms when there are multiple exclusive choices 
        available, and users can select only one option. By giving radio buttons within a 
        group the same name attribute, you ensure that only one option can be selected. -->


        <!-- Select Dropdown -->
        <label for="select-input">Select Input:</label>
        <select id="select-input" name="select-input">
            <option value="option1">Option 1</option>


            <!-- <option>: This is the child element of the <select> tag, and it represents 
            an option within the dropdown list. The value attribute specifies the value that 
            will be sent to the server when the form is submitted. The text between the opening 
            and closing <option> tags represents the visible text for each option. -->


            <option value="option2">Option 2</option>
            <option value="option3">Option 3</option>
        </select><br><br>

        <!-- the <select> tag is used to create a dropdown list, also known as a select 
        menu or a select box. It allows users to choose one or more options from a list 
        of predefined choices. -->



        <!-- File Input -->
        <label for="file-input">File Input:</label>
        <input type="file" id="file-input" name="file-input"><br><br>

        <!-- Date Input -->
        <label for="date-input">Date Input:</label>
        <input type="date" id="date-input" name="date-input"><br><br>

        <!-- When the date input field is rendered in a supporting browser, it typically 
        displays a date picker or calendar interface, making it easier for users to select 
        a date. The appearance and behavior of the date picker may vary slightly across 
        different browsers and operating systems. -->


        <!-- It's important to note that the date input field relies on browser support. 
        Older browsers or those that do not support HTML5 may treat the date input as a 
        regular text input field, allowing users to manually enter a date without the 
        date picker functionality. In such cases, it's crucial to implement server-side 
        validation to ensure the correct format and validity of the date entered by the 
        user. -->

        <!-- Submit Button -->
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">

        <!-- When a user clicks the submit button, it triggers the form's submission process. 
        The form data, including the values of other form controls within the same form, will 
        be sent to the server for processing. The specific behavior after the form submission 
        depends on the server-side implementation. -->


        <!-- By default, when a user presses the Enter key while inside a form field, 
        the browser will trigger the submission of the form as if the submit button 
        was clicked. This behavior can be modified using JavaScript. -->

    </form>
