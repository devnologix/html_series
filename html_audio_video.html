    How can you add audio and video content to an HTML page?
    
    <video controls autoplay loop poster="video-poster.jpg" width="640" height="360">
        <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <source src="video.webm" type="video/webm">
        <source src="video.ogv" type="video/ogg">
        <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a 
            <a href="video.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
        </p>
    </video>


    Let's break down the options used in this example:

    controls: Adds video controls (play/pause, volume, etc.) to the video player.
    width="640" and height="360": Sets the width and height of the video player in pixels.
    <source>: Specifies the video sources in different formats (mp4, webm, and ogv). The 
    browser will choose the first compatible format.
    <p>: A fallback message displayed if the browser doesn't support HTML5 video. It includes 
    a link to download the video file.


    autoplay: Automatically starts playing the video as soon as the page loads.
    loop: Causes the video to restart from the beginning once it reaches the end, creating 
    a continuous loop.
    poster="video-poster.jpg": Sets a specific image (video-poster.jpg) as the video poster, 
    which is displayed before the video starts playing.
    
    Note that the autoplay attribute may not work as expected on some browsers due to 
    restrictions on automatically playing media. To provide a better user experience, 
    it's advisable to include the controls attribute along with autoplay, allowing users 
    to manually start or pause the video if autoplay is blocked.

    Remember to adjust the source file paths (src) and the poster image path (poster) to 
    match the actual file names and locations in your project.
    

    
    You can further customize the <video> tag by using additional attributes like autoplay, 
    loop, poster, etc., depending on your specific requirements.


    <audio controls autoplay loop preload="auto" muted volume="0.5">
        <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
        <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio. Here is a <a href="audio.mp3">link to the audio</a> instead.</p>
    </audio>
      
    autoplay: Automatically starts playing the audio as soon as the page loads.
    
    loop: Causes the audio to restart from the beginning once it reaches the end, creating 
    a continuous loop.
    preload: Specifies how the browser should load the audio file. The possible values 
    are "none", "metadata", and "auto". "none" indicates that the audio should not be 
    preloaded, "metadata" indicates that only metadata should be preloaded, and "auto" 
    indicates that the entire audio file should be preloaded.

    controls: Adds audio controls (play/pause, volume, etc.) to the audio player.
    muted: Starts the audio in a muted state, requiring the user to manually unmute it.

    volume: Sets the default volume level of the audio. The value can range from 0.0 (silent) 
    to 1.0 (maximum volume).

    src: Specifies the source URL of the audio file.
