    <title>Emphasis and Italic</title>
</head>
<body>
    In HTML, the <em> tag and the <i> tag are both used to apply emphasis to text, but they have 
    different purposes and implications.

    The <em> tag is used to indicate emphasis or importance of the enclosed text. It carries a 
    semantic meaning and is typically rendered as italicized by default. The purpose of the <em> 
    tag is to provide emphasis to the text to convey its significance, importance, or stress. 
    Search engines and assistive technologies may interpret <em> text differently or give it more 
    weight when indexing or presenting content.
        
    On the other hand, the <i> tag is primarily used for presentational purposes to apply italic 
    styling to the enclosed text. It doesn't carry any specific semantic meaning or convey importance. 
    The <i> tag simply instructs the browser to render the text in an italic font style. It is 
    commonly used to add visual variety, differentiate a particular word or phrase, or to denote a 
    different language or book title.
        
    While both tags can make text italicized, the key difference lies in their intended purposes. 
    The <em> tag is used for semantic emphasis and to indicate importance, while the <i> tag 
    is used for presentational styling and visual differentiation. It is generally recommended 
    to use the <em> tag when you want to emphasize text with actual importance or meaning, and 
    use the <i> tag for purely presentational purposes or to indicate a different linguistic context.
