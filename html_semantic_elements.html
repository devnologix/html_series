    Semantic elements in HTML are tags that carry meaning and describe the structure and 
    content of the web page. They provide contextual information about the elements they 
    wrap, making it easier for search engines, assistive technologies, and developers to 
    understand the document's purpose. Semantic elements were introduced in HTML5 to 
    promote better structuring and accessibility of web content.

    Here are some examples of semantic elements in HTML5:

    <header>: Represents the introductory content or a container for the site's header. 
    It typically contains the site logo, site title, navigation menu, or other 
    introductory elements.

    <nav>: Defines a section of navigation links. It is used to mark a block of 
    navigation elements, such as a menu or a list of links to different pages or sections 
    within the website.

    <main>: Specifies the main content of the document. It represents the primary content 
    area of the web page, excluding headers, footers, or sidebars. Each document should 
    have only one <main> element.

    <article>: Represents an independent, self-contained piece of content. It can be a 
    blog post, a news article, a forum post, or any other content that can stand 
    alone and be syndicated or distributed independently.

    <section>: Defines a thematic grouping of content. It represents a standalone section 
    of content within a document, typically with its own heading. It helps to organize the 
    content into logical sections.

    <aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the main content. It can 
    be used for sidebars, pull quotes, or additional information that is not essential to 
    understanding the main content but provides supplemental or related information.
    
    The aside content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.

    <footer>: Represents the footer or the bottom section of a web page or a section. It 
    often contains copyright information, contact details, related links, or other 
    information about the site.

    By using semantic elements, developers can create more meaningful and well-structured 
    HTML documents, which improves accessibility, search engine optimization, and overall 
    understanding of the content by both humans and machines.
