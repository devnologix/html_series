    Use of Id in HTML tags


    Sure! When you provide an "id" to a section or div in web development, it's like giving 
    a special name or label to that specific part of a webpage. This helps in a few ways:

    Making the code easier to understand: By giving sections or divs meaningful names, 
    it's easier to see what each part of the code represents. It's like organizing your 
    things with labels so you can find them quickly.

    Finding specific code: If you need to locate a particular section or div while reading or 
    fixing the code, having unique "id" names makes it faster to find what you're looking for. 
    It's like using a search function or map to find a specific room in a big building.

    Communicating with other developers: When discussing the code with your teammates or 
    asking for help, referring to sections or divs by their "id" names makes it easier to 
    point out and talk about specific parts. It's like talking about a particular chapter 
    or paragraph in a book by mentioning its title.

    In simple terms, adding "id" names to sections or divs helps in understanding the code, 
    finding specific parts quickly, and communicating effectively with other developers.

    Disadvantages

    Uniqueness: IDs should be unique, like having a name that belongs to only one person.
    If two elements have the same ID, it can cause problems.
